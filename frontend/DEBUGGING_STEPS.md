# 🔍 Debugging Products Not Showing in Customer Portal

## Issue
Products added by farmers are not displaying in the customer portal, even though backend API works correctly.

## Backend Status ✅
- ✅ Farmer can create products successfully  
- ✅ Customer API returns products correctly
- ✅ Database sync is working
- ✅ CORS is configured properly
- ✅ Authentication works via cURL

## Frontend Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Access Debug Panel
1. Open React app: http://localhost:3000
2. Login as customer (if not already logged in)
3. Go to Customer Dashboard
4. Click "🔍 Debug Auth" in sidebar
5. Follow the debug panel instructions

### Step 2: Test Authentication
1. Click "🔑 Test Customer Login" in debug panel
2. Check if token is stored properly
3. Verify role is set to "customer"

### Step 3: Test API Connection
1. Click "🛍️ Test Marketplace API" in debug panel
2. Check browser console for network requests
3. Verify products are returned

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Click "🛒 Instant Buy" in customer dashboard
4. Look for marketplace loading logs:
   - "🔍 Marketplace: Starting to load products..."
   - "🔑 Token: Present/Missing"
   - "✅ Marketplace: API Response received"
   - "📦 Products data"

### Expected Results
- Token should be present in localStorage
- API should return products successfully
- Console should show successful product loading
- Products should display in marketplace

### Common Issues
1. **No Token**: User not logged in properly
2. **Wrong Role**: User logged in as farmer instead of customer  
3. **Network Error**: CORS or connectivity issue
4. **Component Error**: React rendering issue

### Test Credentials
- **Customer**: email: `customer@test.com`, password: `password123`
- **Farmer**: email: `farmer@test.com`, password: `password123`

## Next Steps
Based on debug panel results:
- If login fails → Check backend authentication
- If API fails → Check network/CORS
- If both pass but products don't show → Check React components
