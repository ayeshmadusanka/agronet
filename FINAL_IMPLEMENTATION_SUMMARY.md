## **📊 How the Stats System Works**

### **Contracts Card**
- **Data Source**: Searches all contracts for applications with matching `farmer_id`
- **Updates**: Real-time when farmer applies to contracts via `/api/contracts/{id}/apply`
- **Display**: Shows total number of contract applications submitted

### **Sales Card**  
- **Data Source**: Finds farmer's products, then searches OrderItems for those products
- **Calculations**: 
  - Total Sales = Sum of all OrderItem.total_price for farmer's products
  - Orders Count = Unique order_id count from OrderItems
  - Farmer Earnings = Total Sales - Platform Commission
  - Platform Commission = Total Sales × Commission Rate (0% or 10%)
- **Updates**: Real-time when customers place orders containing farmer's products

### **Subscription Card**
- **Data Source**: User model subscription fields
- **Updates**: Real-time when subscription changes via upgrade/downgrade APIs
- **Display**: Current tier, commission rate, verification status, expiry date
